# ToDoList

This a landing page I'be build usins SCSS. It also contains my first attempts to modifying DOM elements with Javascript. There are couple of modules on the page that use (native Javascript). Some of the modules are in the works at the moment, therefore they might not look as good as they should be. Layout also includes RWD.

## Services section

I wanted to create sort of gallery component here where user can click on the block and expand it. For the moment the component is stil in the works: it containts dirty code (requires clean up) and also it doesn't work properly on mobile.
